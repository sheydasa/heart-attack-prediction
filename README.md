# Heart Attack Prediction

## Overview
The Heart Attack Prediction project focuses on developing a predictive model aimed at assessing an individualâ€™s susceptibility to heart attacks. Using a dataset with 303 samples and 14 variables including sex, age, chest pain, and more, the objective is to build an algorithm to predict the likelihood of heart attacks in patients.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset).
