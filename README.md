# Heart Attack Prediction

## Overview
The Heart Attack Prediction project focuses on developing a predictive model to assess an individualâ€™s likelihood of experiencing a heart attack. Using a dataset containing 303 samples and 14 variables-including sex, age, chest pain, and more-the objective is to build and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithm to predict heart attack risks in patients. 
The models tested include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with the goal of determining the most accurate approach.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset). The downloaded dataset needs to be saved as 'heart.csv' in the same directory as the script.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- The 'heart.csv' dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset)
- The dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt'

## Installation Instructions
